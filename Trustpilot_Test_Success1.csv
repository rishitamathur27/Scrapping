For $18 per meal I'd expect not to have plastic in my food.  The food was not great. It lacked flavor and substance. The soup tasted like wet dog which was hard to eat (but again for $18 I forced myself to). I did enjoy the acorn squash meal most. The salads should not be included.

Once I became familiar with the ordering process I was able to get the meals I preferred. Often I would only see duplicate meals in one week because the menu might not be varied enough for my taste. The meals are perfectly balanced nutritionally which I appreciate because when I cooking my own meals -this was a challenge. The Meals arrive like clockwork each week, fresh and packed in ice. My only complaint is when I eat out, I‚Äôm not sure if I can freeze some of the meals if they begin to pile up because they are fresh, e.g salads, etc In summary, I‚Äôm enjoying the pleasure of not having to cook especially since I‚Äôm single with only myself to worry about.",TRUE,https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.sprinly.com
